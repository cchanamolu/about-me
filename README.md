I bring a wealth of experience as a Software Engineer with a 4.5-year track record, known for my results-driven approach and proficiency in the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). My expertise extends to project management methodologies, including Waterfall and Agile/Scrum. I excel in communication and organization and aim to leverage my skills in a software engineering role that contributes to lasting improvements in applications and company achievements.

My technical skills encompass Java, SQL, PL/SQL, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with experience in databases like Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, and IBM DB2. I'm well-versed in J2EE technologies, using JDBC, Spring, and Spring Boot, and I'm familiar with various architectural patterns such as MVC and microservices. In the realm of ORM frameworks, I've worked with Hibernate, JPA, and Spring Data. My toolset includes IDEs like STS, Eclipse, My Eclipse, and Intellij IDEA, while I've deployed applications on servers like Apache Tomcat 9.0 and IBM WebSphere 8. Build tools like Gradle, Maven, and Apache ANT are in my arsenal, and I'm proficient in version control using GIT. Testing is another strength; I've used JUnit, Mockito, Rest Client API, Postman, Swagger UI 2, and have experience in mutation testing, BDD testing, and RPA. Logging is vital, and I've employed Log4j and Slf4j for this purpose. Messaging systems like Kafka and Active MQ are not foreign to me, and I'm well-versed in CI/CD tools like Jenkins, UrbanCodeDeploy, and Jfrog. Furthermore, I've explored cloud technologies, including AWS Lambda, Dynamo DB, and CloudWatch.

In my most recent role at Lending Club, I was a key contributor to loan servicing, where I actively managed one-time and recurring payments, generated payoff quotes, and enrolled delinquent borrowers in payment plans. My work there included designing REST APIs using the Spring and Spring Boot frameworks and efficiently implementing batch jobs, utilizing the Quartz framework. This approach ensured that approximately 7,000 borrowers were brought up to date daily. My technical skills came to the fore as I handled a significant volume of loans obtained from the EDH via REST APIs and optimized performance through multithreading techniques, reducing batch job processing time by an impressive 1,000 milliseconds. I also made vital contributions to the creation of payment plans for consumers by developing queries and retrieving necessary information from the MySQL database.

At Lending Club, I leveraged AWS Lambda to design and deploy batch jobs, automatically triggering the High-risk cache Job on a predefined schedule. My work with the BizOps framework played a crucial role in managing and storing failed processes within the Oracle database, leading to a significant 100% improvement in payment scheduling during the loan onboarding process. I also implemented Kafka streaming to capture, process, and transform loan creation/modification events from upstream services into legal and email notifications. My fine-tuning of Kafka consumer threads in response to traffic and producer partitions resulted in a remarkable 50% improvement in consumer performance. Additionally, I contributed to operational excellence by creating Splunk and Wavefront dashboards that effectively collected and presented essential performance data and transaction rates for our services.

I also played a crucial role in configuring multiple Jenkins pipelines, streamlining the CI/CD process for various projects and contributing to efficient and rapid software delivery. My utilization of JFrog for artifactory management further improved our processes.

In my role at Wells Fargo, I worked in a Microservices environment on projects like WebATM and MRDC. This involved developing REST API endpoints using the Spring Boot framework, utilizing Apache Kafka for data consumption, conducting consistent code refactoring, and implementing API automation testing using tools like Postman. I also played a key role in deployment activities using Urban Code Deploy and leveraged Jenkins for continuous integration.

During my tenure at Health Care Service Corporation, I assisted in developing Provider Information Enterprise Relations (PIER), a project that handles provider information and is built using microservices. I also played an important role in migrating from the legacy system, Premier Provider Web (PPW), to PIER. My responsibilities included creating JPA's, developing endpoints, and utilizing Rest APIs and Spring Boot for business logic. I documented endpoints using Swagger, used HQL for database querying, and performed unit and integration testing.

My educational background includes a Master's in Computer Science from California State University, San Bernardino, and a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technology University in Kakinada, India.
